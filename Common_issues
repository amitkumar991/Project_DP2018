1. When running on local server meta-mask shows error: Tx does not have correct nonce.Tx have nonce of x while account have nonce
of y.
Sol: this is due some known meta-mask issue so while on your webpage just goto metamask->settings and reset account.
     Refresh the page and it should be fine now.
